WHY IS IT SO HARD?

Why is devops hiring so hard?

The lack of education in the devops space is a huge problem that stems from a clear, defined idea of what devops skills are. 

This stems from a different understanding of what devops means by recruiters, managers, operations professionals, developers, and just about everyone.

There is no single definition of devops that means all the things to all the people, nor should there be.

I think to make hiring for devops professionals start making sense, we need to fracture this movement into more discrete chunks in terms of what we're talking about. 

CAMS makes a lot of sense to me in what devops means, but this is really only after seeing it work and working at it for a few years in different organizations, with different people, all over the world. I was lucky enough to work at an org that took these things seriously and didn't just hire for automation engineers.

aint nobody got time for that

To me, inarguably the most important aspect of devops is the awareness that your

Sharing:

The typical leader in the devops world has a long history in systems administration and/or systems programming, got frustrated, started writing software to address those problems, saw the agile light, loved it/hated it, then applied those principles to systems operations and systems administration. 

Some then applied those principles to larger organizational changes that give everyone involved in the process of making, delivering, and using the software some level of feedback.

That's a long road to take, and we can't expect everyone a recruiter slides across your inbox to have taken that journey.

SO HOW DO I BECOME A DEVOPS?

We can't even decide on a job title.

We can't rely on nature to create these people. Systems administration as a job title is going the way of the DBA. Highly specialized individuals that do not or cannot change roles or move in their org because they have become irreplaceable. 

What to do about that? 
We've yet to see if dev bootcamps solve anything about the shortage of developers. Many developers have strong and low opinions of dev bootcamps and bootcamp graduates. That is not something that is talked about much in the 

Since much of systems administration is "tribal knowledge", how can we make a curriculum around it? As I see it the big problem is around nomenclature. devops is not infrastructure automation. Devops is not release engineering. Devops is a culture not a job title. All of these efforts around defining devops as a movement and a cultural shift have been detrimental to the hiring pool in my opinion. These kind of conversations have led to the understanding of devops as a set of tools that only a few can use. 

Here I go repeating them.

We need a name for the kitchen sink of technologies and practices that people think of when they think of devops, and come up with a curriculum for that. 

Infrastructure automation, deploy-ability patterns, the 12 factor app principles, these things need an umbrella term that is general enough to teach a course on without worrying too much about vendors or specific technologies.
