WHY IS IT SO HARD?


Why is devops hiring so hard?
The lack of education in the devops space is a huge problem that stems from a clear, defined idea of what devops skills are. The typical leader in the devops world has a long history in systems administration or systems programming, got frustrated, started writing software, saw the agile light, applied that to operations and administration. We can't rely on nature to create these people. Systems administration as a job title is going the way of the DBA. Highly specialized individuals that do not or cannot change roles or move in their org because they have become irreplaceable. 

What to do about that? 
We've yet to see if dev bootcamps solve anything about the shortage of developers. Many developers have strong and low opinions of dev bootcamp graduates. Since much of systems administration is "tribal knowledge", how can we make a curriculum around it? As I see it the big problem is around nomenclature. devops is not infrastructure automation. Devops is not release engineering. Devops is a culture not a job title. All of these efforts around defining devops as a movement and a cultural shift have been detrimental to the hiring pool in my opinion. These kind of conversations have led to the understanding of devops as a set of tools that only a few can use. 

We need a name for the kitchen sink of technologies and practices that people think of when they think of devops, and come up with a curriculum for that. 

Infrastructure automation, deploy-ability patterns, the 12 factor app principles, these things need an umbrella term that is general enough to teach a course on without worrying too much about vendors or specific technologies.
