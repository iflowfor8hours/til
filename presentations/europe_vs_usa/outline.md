* Differences between how Europe and the US view DevOps, having worked on both sides of the pond

Every company is different, but culturally I have seen more large enterprises in the US take devops (as a culture) seriously than in the UK. I think this is a maturity of market question that will eventually equalize as time goes on. I'm not sure how interesting this question is in terms of getting real data since I'm not really supposed to talk about clients specfically, and my role is not high level enough to have seen statistically significant numbers of orgs for a comparison.
