Abstract

Containers and microservice thinking have changed the way we deploy and build software for the cloud. The tooling and technologies have evolved quickly, but release methodologies have have not seen the same pace of evolution.

This session will demonstrate some of the shifting concerns and considerations of build and deployment pipelines during and after the transition to containers. It will explore the impact of new tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS Lambda on the build, release and deployment cycle of your applications and services.

It will also discuss some of the common patterns and cultural considerations that have been successful for companies transitioning to modern ways of working.
