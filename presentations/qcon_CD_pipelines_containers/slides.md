# Who am I

Note: I'm Matt Urbanski, the technology principal for a company called Contino. I've been doing CD and devops consulting for about 5 years now, and prior to that was a sysadmin and developer for many years. I've worked in finance, retail, banking, insurance and many other industries across every continent that needs devops. I have always been interested in the problem of source to binary control of application delivery, and like thinking about the challenges around artifact promotion, configuration management, service discovery, and scaling.

# Who is Contino

Note: Contino is a devops consultancy based in London, but very recently opened an office in NY. We're about 50 strong now and 2 and a half years old. We are a well-funded and targeted devops startup that does devops transformations, cloud migrations, CD consulting, and some custom software delivery projects where appropriate.

# What is this about?

Note: Containers have changed the way that many companies build, test, and distribute software. There has been a sprawl of different approaches that integrate containerization and pipeline technologies. The diversity of ways in which I have seen the two concepts used in concert has been staggering, and like everything else with a sudden, massive uptick in popularity, mixed results.



Pipelines, the lowest common denominator.
