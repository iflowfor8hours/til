Security, like performance, is often viewed as outside the scope of a CD pipeline as it is often difficult to address these concerns in an automated way.


Security in the pipeline
  Application security, how to test?
    Does OWASP zap deliver value?
    Does gauntlt deliver value?
  Regression tests, do you write them when bugs are discovered?

Security of the pipeline
  Who can deploy?
  Who has access to see and change the pipeline components?
    Are all the environments the same?
  Who has access to artifacts?
  How do components communicate?

Security as process
  Security sprints?
  Configuration audits with risk analysis
  Patch levels and vulnerability subscriptions
  Critical updates auto installed?

Secrets management
Log output and access
Security alerting
Threat detection is not important if you don't know you've been hacked.
